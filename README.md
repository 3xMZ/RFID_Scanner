# Project Title

RFID Based Puck Verification for Swage Robot 


## Description

Reads RFID chip and outputs a voltage based on which Puck the RFID belongs to.

### Sensors Used

1x RFID Reader


## Getting Started

Program with Arduino Micro settings on the Arduino IDE.<br/>
Make sure you have the libraries for RFID and the DAC.

### Prerequisites

```
Arduino IDE
Adafruit_PN532 Library
Adafruit_MCP4725 Library
```


### Hardware Prerequisites

-BWC_Duino<br/>
-RFID PCB<br/>
-RFID<br/>
-5 V Power Supply<br/>

### Modifying the Code

-Find out what the replacement RFID chip address is.  You can do this with a NFC app or use this program.<br/>
-Replace the desired address of the puck in the address array.<br/>
